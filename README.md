# 🖥️ btop — AMD GPU Build

**Pre-built [`btop`](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop) binaries with AMD GPU (ROCm SMI) support, automatically compiled and published via GitHub Actions.**

## 🚀 What is this?

Upstream `btop` ships GPU monitoring support, but most distribution packages are compiled **without** it. This repo provides a **GitHub Actions pipeline** that:

1. Installs the **ROCm SMI** development library from AMD's official apt repository
2. Clones the latest `btop` source from [aristocratos/btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop)
3. Compiles with `GPU_SUPPORT=true` and `STATIC=false` (required for `dlopen`-based GPU detection)
4. Uploads the binary as a **GitHub Actions artifact** (and as a **Release asset** when a tag is pushed)

> **This repo does not contain any `btop` source code.** It only provides the build infrastructure.

---

## 📦 Download

### From GitHub Releases *(recommended)*

Go to the [Releases page](../../releases) and grab the latest `btop` binary for your architecture.

### From GitHub Actions Artifacts

Every successful run of the [build workflow](../../actions/workflows/build-amd-gpu.yaml) uploads a build artifact named `btop-amdgpu-linux-x86_64-<version>`. Artifacts are retained for **30 days**.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

| Runtime requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **ROCm** (any recent version) | Must be installed on the target machine |
| `librocm_smi64.so` | Ships with `rocm-smi-lib`; btop uses `dlopen()` to load it |
| **Linux x86_64** | Only architecture currently built |
| **glibc ≥ 2.38** | Binary is built on Ubuntu 26.04 |

> If `librocm_smi64.so` is **not** present at runtime, btop falls back gracefully and works normally without GPU stats.

### Quick install

```bash
# Install ROCm SMI library (required for GPU panel)
sudo apt-get install rocm-smi-lib        # Ubuntu/Debian (ROCm apt repo)
# or
sudo dnf install rocm-smi-lib            # Fedora/RHEL

# Download the binary (replace <version> with the actual version)
curl -Lo btop https://github.com/nargothrond/btop-amd-gpu-build/releases/latest/download/btop
chmod +x btop
sudo mv btop /usr/local/bin/

# Run it!
btop
```

Press **`5`** inside btop to show the GPU monitoring panel.

## 🔄 Build Triggers

The workflow runs automatically on:

| Event | When |
|---|---|
| **Nightly schedule** | `03:00 UTC` every day — picks up upstream fixes |
| **Push to `main`** | On every commit to this repo |
| **Manual dispatch** | You can specify any btop branch/tag/commit |

### Manual dispatch

1. Go to [Actions → Build btop with AMD GPU Support](../../actions/workflows/build-amd-gpu.yaml)
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Optionally enter a specific btop branch, tag, or commit hash
4. Click **Run workflow** ✅
